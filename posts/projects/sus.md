# Alive SMP Season 2
## Whats Happening?

We are ending season 1, to start season 2 with even more content!

## How to Join?

We are looking for truely dedicated players, you dont have to be playing 24/7, but if you feel like you are barely gonna play then don't apply. Also we would like to have people that have good skills, such as building, redstone, or pvp.

## New Features

The new world is gonna have custom world generation done by Stardust labs (Terralith, Incendium, Nullscape, and Structory), with a unique seed, there are now many more places to explore! View the [world map](https://map.alivesmp.xyz).

And the whole concept is now different. Instead of a simple vanilla SMP, we've changed it to a civilizations type. We've changed the claiming plugin to Lands, so you can create nations, certain areas to players to create a town! 
You can also start wars with other nations. There is even more features to this plugin, to know more view this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/N6HExtO_L6s?t=40).

The Lands claiming plugin does require an economy, so we are now bringing economy to the SMP! You can trade out supplies for money at the spawn, and create shops your self on the spawn island!

I've also custom coded a plugin called Lively! It is a semi-hardcore survival solution. If you've watched "3rd life", then its kind of like that! You start off with 1 life, and as you level up on Adapt you gain more lives, when you kill someone they loose a life and you gain one, and you can craft lives!

One more thing, we are adding a brand new leveling plugin called Adapt! There are many cool features, skills, that you can view on this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcsnaUnuh6hq3v4nxIZ_bbY6HZmwBADt6).
